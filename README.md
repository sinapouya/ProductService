🚀 Learning Journey in Microservices Architecture 🚀

Hey LinkedIn family! 👋 I'm thrilled to share the first section of my microservices journey, focusing on the ProductService microservice.

🌐 Project Overview:

I've developed a robust Spring Boot application for managing products—a crucial component of a larger shopping application. The ProductService microservice efficiently handles product creation, retrieval, and more.

📂 Project Structure:

- Entities: Utilizing MongoDB for data storage, I've created a `Product` entity that serves as the model for our products.
- DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): The `ProductDto` ensures seamless communication between layers and incorporates data validation for robustness.
- Repository: Leveraging Spring Data MongoDB, the `ProductRepository` facilitates smooth interactions with the database.
- Service Layer: The `ProductService` is the heart of the business logic, managing processes like product creation and retrieval.

🔧 Tech Stack:

- Spring Boot: Harnessing the power of Spring Boot for accelerated development.
- MongoDB: Opting for MongoDB due to its flexibility and scalability.
- Validation: Incorporating Jakarta Bean Validation for robust data validation.
- Testing: Employing JUnit 5 and Testcontainers for comprehensive testing.
